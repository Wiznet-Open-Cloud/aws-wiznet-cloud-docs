# Available iOS and Android Devices for the Online Emulator/Simulator

Below is the full list of currently available device and OS version options for the online iOS simulators and Android emulators. The devices, OS versions, and updates as major versions are released or as the virtual devices get deprecated.

iOS devices are run through the iOS simulators on Xcode and Android devices are run through the Android emulators on Android Studio. For this reason, x86 support is required for running the apps on virtual devices.
