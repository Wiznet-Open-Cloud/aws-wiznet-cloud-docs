# Online Android Emulator for Web Sites

Appcircle online Android Emulator allows you to visit websites on an Android device in the browser without the need for Android Studio or any downloads.

To use the Android Emulator for web sites, you only need to enter a URL.

To start, click the Emulator/Simulator button from the left menu and then click the "Android Browser on Android Emulator" button.

The website will then be accessed from the emulator. You can now use it just like an actual device. To end your session, just navigate away from the emulator screen. Your session will not be preserved.
