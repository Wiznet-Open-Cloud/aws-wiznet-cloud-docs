# Online iOS Simulator for Web Sites

Appcircle online iOS Simulator allows you to visit websites on an iOS device in the browser without the need for a Mac, Xcode or any downloads.

To use the iOS Simulator for web sites, you only need to enter a URL.



To start, click the Emulator/Simulator button from the left menu and then click the "Safari on iOS Simulator" button.

The website will then be accessed from the simulator. You can now use it just like an actual device. To end your session, just navigate away from the simulator screen. Your session will not be preserved.
