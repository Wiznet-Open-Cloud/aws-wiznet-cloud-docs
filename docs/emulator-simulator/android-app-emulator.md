# Online Android Emulator for Apps

Appcircle online Android Emulator allows you to upload APK files and run them on an Android device in the browser without the need for Android Studio or any downloads.

To use the Android Emulator, you need to have an APK file that is compatible with the x86 architecture.;

To start, click the Emulator/Simulator button from the left menu and then click the "Upload an APK" button.
