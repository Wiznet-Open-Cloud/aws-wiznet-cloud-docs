# Connecting to GitLab

## Connecting to gitlab.com

If you authorize Appcircle to access your repositories on GitLab, you can select the repository that you want to connect in the next screen.

![](<https://cdn.appcircle.io/docs/assets/image (238).png>)

After you click on **GitLab**, the following screen will appear. This will let you choose between selecting a repository which you are already authorized Appcircle to do or ask your consent about authorizing more repositories.

When you successfully authorize your account, the following screen will appear to let you select one for connection:

After the connection is successful, you can [view your newly created profile](https://docs.appcircle.io/build/adding-a-build-profile#view-the-newly-created-build-profile) and start building!

## Connecting to GitLab Self Hosted Repository

Overall process is similar with private repository connection through SSH, but Appcircle allows to directly connect through GitLab Self Hosted URL.

First, select **GitLab **and\*\* **then **Connect Self-hosted GitLab\*\* through the menu:

Fill the relevant information about your Gitlab self-hosted module. If you are not sure what those are, contact your system administrator.

### Connection Notice

For Appcircle to connect to the Self Hosted GitLab Instance, your connection must be reachable over the internet.&#x20;

:::

Is your self-hosted GitLab instance under enterprise firewall? Learn which IP addresses and ports Appcircle uses to function under the whitelist documentation:

<ContentRef url="../../infrastructure/accessing-repositories-in-internal-networks-firewalls">
  Accessing Repositories in Internal Networks (Firewalls)
</ContentRef>

### Token Creation

GitLab has two kinds of token at their Self Hosted instance:

- [Personal Access Token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/security/token_overview.html#personal-access-tokens)
- [Project Access Token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/security/token_overview.html#project-access-tokens)

Both works to connect your repository through Appcircle. That being said, **Project Access Token **is used to authorize a single project(repository) and **Personal Access Token **is used to authorize every repository the user has access to.

:::info

Appcircle needs admin permission to function properly. The admin permission is needed to create relevant WebHooks automatically.
