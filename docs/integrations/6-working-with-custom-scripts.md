# Working with Custom Scripts

Custom script is a powerful workflow step which allows you to add almost any kind of action to your builds.

You can also take advantage of the [reserved environment variables](../../environment-variables/appcircle-specific-environment-variables.md) or [your own environment variables and secrets](../../environment-variables/managing-variables.md) to utilize the outputs in the custom scripts or provide inputs to other workflow steps.

The following guides provide in-depth information on how the custom scripts can be used in various use cases:

{% content-ref url="custom-script-faq.md" %}
[custom-script-faq.md](custom-script-faq.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="custom-script-samples.md" %}
[custom-script-samples.md](custom-script-samples.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
